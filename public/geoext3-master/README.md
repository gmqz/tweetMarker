GeoExt is Open Source and enables building desktop-like GIS applications through the web. It is a JavaScript framework that combines the GIS functionality of OpenLayers with the user interface savvy of the ExtJS library provided by Sencha.

Version 3 of GeoExt is the successor to the GeoExt 2.x-series and is built atop the newest official installments of its base libraries; OpenLayers 3 and ExtJS 6.

Geoext 3 is not released yet, and we are actively developing it. Right now it is neither feature complete, nor fully tested. Everybody is invited to help us create the next version of GeoExt.

The goal is to implement upcoming GeoExt releases as an
[ExtJS-Package](https://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/cmd_packages/cmd_packages.html).

##More information on GeoExt 3

Have a look at the official homepage: http://geoext.github.io/geoext3/

You will find examples, API documentation (with and without inherited functionality from ExtJS), links to mailinglists and more over there.

What you see on http://geoext.github.io/geoext3/ are the contents of the gh-pages-branch. If you encounter anything that should be fixed, please issue a pull request against that branch and we will merge it as soon as possible.

## Initial Codesprint

To kickstart the new GeoExt 3 project a code sprint has been done in Bonn from 17th to 19th of June 2015.

## Use GeoExt 3 inside your Sencha app

GeoExt 3 is a [ExtJS package](http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/6.x/cmd_packages/cmd_packages.html). It can be used as any other ExtJS package, taking advantage of Sencha cmd.

To help with your first GeoExt 3 project, follow the instructions provided to build a [GeoExt 3 Universal app](universal-app.md). This app runs on the desktop and on mobile.
